## Writings

You can find a few on [Clojure blog](http://clojure.com/blog), [Cognitect blog](http://blog.cognitect.com/?author=53b41822e4b03d3e9732635e), and [InfoQ](http://infoq.com/author/Rich-Hickey#Articles).

There's also an old paper (1994) on C++: [Callbacks in C++ using template functors](http://tutok.sk/fastgl/callback.html).
He made some comments on it in [an interview](http://codequarterly.com/2011/rich-hickey) years later:

> Fogus: In an old paper of yours, “Callbacks in C++ Using Template Functors”, you write favorably about C++, OOP, and static typing. Why did you change your mind?
> 
> Hickey: I’m not sure I did. I said C++ was flexible—it is—and that, when implementing a callback system for C++, one should remain aligned with its object orientation and static typing. More interesting to me, in rereading it, is that I am still now making the same arguments I made then, fifteen years ago, against mixins and derivation as extension mechanisms.
> 
> That said, I certainly was a fan of C++ in the day, and five more years of it cured me of that. The complexity is stunning. It failed as the library language it purported to be, due to lack of GC, in my opinion, and static typing failed to keep large OO systems from becoming wretched balls of mud. Large mutable object graphs are the sore point, and const is inadequate to address it. Once C++’s performance advantage eroded or became less important, you had to wonder—why bother? I can’t imagine working in a language without GC today, except in very special circumstances.
> 
> Along the way, I discovered Common Lisp, which was much more flexible, dynamic, simpler, and fast enough, and decided that was how I wanted to program. Finally, with Clojure, that is becoming possible, and practical, for me.
